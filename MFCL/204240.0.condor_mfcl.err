 Tag recapture 8 from tag group 78 was caught in year 271 month 2
 in fishery 21 but there was no realization of this fishery at that time 
 tyear = 269 tmonth = 2
 tyear1 = 272 tmonth1 = 2
Initial_tag_period for recapture 8 for tag group 78 in region 4
 is greater than the tag period being  assigned 
 I think this tag was caught before it was released

 Tag recapture 8 from tag group 78 was caught in year 271 month 2
 in fishery 21 but there was no realization of this fishery at that time 
 tyear = 269 tmonth = 2
 tyear1 = 272 tmonth1 = 2
Initial_tag_period for recapture 8 for tag group 78 in region 4
 is greater than the tag period being  assigned 
 I think this tag was caught before it was released
